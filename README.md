Octave script for loading OpenRocket simulations and performing statistical analysis on the provided data. Allows for plotting the trajectories on Octave, or exporting .kml files that can be loaded directly on GoogleEarth.
The simulation files are generated on OpenRocket and exported with the Impact Dispersion listener developed by the team, which is also available on github. Once the .csv file is loaded, which can take some time, the data can be saved on a binary file proper for Octave, and then loaded again much faster.
This program was developed in service for the Capital Rocket Team, it is made available for anyone to use, study, and extend, as they will. Please, reference the team, or me, when using this software.
